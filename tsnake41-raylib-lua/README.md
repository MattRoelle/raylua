# About TSnake41's version

> WARNING: This is customized bindings and might not get updated!

This version is custom one that uses [TSnake41's raylib-lua](https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua) bindings, However it's currently works only on 64-bit Microsoft Windows via 64-bit LuaJIT compiler (I used [ULua](https://ulua.io) for that).

It uses TSnake41's bindings, Which adds Physac to my bindings.

I added [physics_demo.lua](https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua/blob/master/examples/physics_demo.lua) from his repository, You can see how it works good with my custom bindings that uses his bindings...

Looking forward for more support!
